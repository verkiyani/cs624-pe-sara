# Input  
The application begins by accepting two types of input: user input and static input. The user input is collected through a `TextInput` component.

# Process  
The core processing logic of the application lies in how the input is rendered and styled using React Native components and internal layout control. The main component of the app is an arrow function called `App`, which returns a layout wrapped in a `ScrollView`. This ensures that all content remains accessible regardless of the screen size or orientation.  

# Output  
The output is a scrollable mobile interface that displays MSCS program courses in a clear and visually appealing format.
