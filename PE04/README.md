# Input

The application begins with a single Profile Card . In Part 1, additional static content like the user's name, occupation, and description was added. In Part 2, this concept was expanded into a gallery with six cards.

# Process

In Part 1, I applied basic text styling using `StyleSheet.create`, learned how to control font size, weight, alignment, and spacing using React Native styles. In Part 2, I expanded this into a dynamic system using an interactive ProfileCard component that toggles between expanded and thumbnail modes.

# Output

The output of Part 1 is a well-styled single Profile Card with complete text information. The output of Part 2 is a scrollable list of six Profile Cards that can expand and collapse on tap.
