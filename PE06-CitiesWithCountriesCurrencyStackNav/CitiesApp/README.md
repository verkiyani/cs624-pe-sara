Input
In this app, the user can enter two types of data: cities and countries. In the AddCity tab, the user types the city name and country name. In the AddCountry tab, the user types the country name and its currency. 

Process
The app uses React Native with React Navigation to create a mobile app with four tabs: Cities, AddCity, Countries, and AddCountry.

Output
The Cities and Countries tabs display the list of added items. If no data has been added yet, a message appears like "No saved cities!" or "No saved countries!" Each city shows its name and country, and each country shows its name and currency.
